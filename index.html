    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      This graph shows trendlines for all the stocks included in the dataset, with time along the x-axis and stock value along the y-axis. Click anywhere to add a filter box. The trendlines will be filtered to only include those that pass through all the filter boxes. Click and drag in the center of a filter box to move it. Click and drag on the blue outline of a filter box to resize that box. Dragging from the corner of the box will change the height and width of the box simultaneously. To delete a box, click and drag as if you were going to move it, then move your mouse over the trash icon in the bottom-right corner of the graph, and release the mouse.
